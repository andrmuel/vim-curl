# curl.vim

curl.vim is a simple wrapper to use curl from within Vim.

It provides the following commands:

* `:CurlGet` - performs HTTP GET calls
* `:CurlHead` - performs HTTP HEAD calls
* `:CurlPost` - performs HTTP POST calls
* `:CurlPut` - performs HTTP PUT calls
* `:CurlDelete` - performs HTTP DELETE calls

## Installation

I recommend using [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/andrmuel/vim-curl.git
